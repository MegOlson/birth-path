        <h3>Your Birth Path Number is 1!</h3><p>The number one is a spiritual and primal force. It is the root that all numbers stem from. This is perhaps why Ones tend to be doers. If you are a One then you are aggressive and energetic. You look to produce results and you will not be limited by anyone or anything. Your innate urge to be a protector and your dedication and passion to achieving your goals make you a natural born leader and show why this number is related to a fatherly role. Even the shape of the number 1 is a strong reflection of its meaning. The 1 is a spearhead, always at the lead and often forceful. It stands upright, unwavering in its pride and purpose. You are courageous and willing to try anything new if you see promise, even at great danger.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="two">
        <h3>Your Birth Path Number is 2!</h3>The number two is thought to be a feminine number, with its power and strength consistently underestimated. Twos tend to be artists of sorts, always gentle, understanding, and diplomatic. If you are a two, you are a natural born peacekeeper, whose innate urge is to diffuse situations rather than fight. However, as we said, Twos are often underestimated.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="three">
        <h3>Your Birth Path Number is 3!</h3>Threes are natural born salesmen, with a natural gift for gab and overflow of charisma. If you’re a three, you’re the star of the party and liven up any room without even trying. You have a natural gift for creativity and you are well aware of your talent. However, Threes are also a bit like spoiled teenagers. They are disorganized, in need of constant guidance, and blissfully unaware or ungrateful for the efforts others go through to protect them.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="four">
        <h3>Your Birth Path Number is 4!</h3>Fours are orderly and methodical and base their lives in logic. If you’re a Four, you are the epitome of stability. You use hard work and reason to establish a solid foundation and believe any problem can be overcome with a proper plan. Often thought to be a more masculine number, the 4’s shape says it all - hard linear edges with no room for flow or flexibility.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="five">
        <h3>Your Birth Path Number is 5!</h3>Fives are a whirlwind of energy, constantly in need of change and stimulation. If you are a Five, your family and friends probably view you as independent and unpredictable. You’re always up for an adventure and aren’t averse to taking risks. While you are surprisingly loyal, you can also be selfish, thoughtless and irresponsible, leaving a wake of damage for others to clean up.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="six">
        <h3>Your Birth Path Number is 6!</h3>Nicknamed the motherhood number, the Six is a fixer. You are naturally caring and protective and you dedicate your life to fixing the problems of those around you. Sixes are the glue that holds families and communities together and they will protect their loved ones at any cost.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="seven">
        <h3>Your Birth Path Number is 7!</h3>Sevens are naturally curious and as a result find themselves devoted to investigating the unknown. However, you possess all of the skills to handle this challenge. You have a refined and analytical mind that is capable of great insight. Where others see only broken pieces, Sevens see a puzzle waiting to be solved. You are a strong mix of intellectual creativity and practical logic.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="eight">
        <h3>Your Birth Path Number is 8!</h3>Eights place emphasis on career, business, finances and authority. You are spiritual, but maintain a practicality and realism to your spirituality. You know the difference between make-believe and genuine realizations. However, you are also perfectly balanced and are a force that creates as easily as it destroys.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="nine">
        <h3>Your Birth Path Number is 9!</h3>You lack the perspective that would otherwise allow you to enjoy life more fully. You have trouble accepting humanities natural limitations and therefore keep pushing, often sacrificing your own happiness to do so. You have a gift for examining the world objectively. Apply this to your own life and be honest with yourself. While it’s easy to withdraw, you must openly face your own shortcomings to better understand and appreciate love.</p>
